# Details

A very simple demo app for [filepicke-padrino](https://github.com/bookworm/filepicker-padrino) base on Max Tilfords [filepicker-rails-demo](https://github.com/maxtilford/filepicker-rails-demo)

# Usage

You need to set `ENV['FILEPICKER_API_KEY'] = 'XXXX'` with your API key and then you just go through the normal Padrino `bundle instal`, `bundle exec padrino start` process. It's very simple :)
